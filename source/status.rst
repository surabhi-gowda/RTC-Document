Current Status and Next Steps
=============================

- Frequency compensation applied; monitoring ongoing.
- CLKOUT measurement frequency getting 32.7677kHz. 

Next Steps
----------

- Execute focused test cases (H5, H6) to validate crystal and long-term stability
- Direct crystal frequency measurement at oscillator pins
- Fine-tune compensation based on ppm error
